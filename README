Confiture
=========

Generate config files for your applications. Start with an easy to edit yml file and have confiture generate for example Apache or God config files for you.

    git clone git://github.com/jnicklas/confiture.git 
    cd confiture
    rake package
    sudo gem install pkg/confiture*

You should generate your personal stub of templates, these can then be adapted to fit your needs

    confiture init
    
Edit the /etc/confiture/config.yml file, and point it to where you want your config files to be located.

Confiture will by default look for config files in:

    /var/app/you_app_name/app.yml
    
so create an app.yml file in that directory. The syntax for this file is documented below. You might want to symlink it from your app if you use capistrano:

    ln -s /var/app/your_app_name/current/config/deploy.yml /var/app/your_app_name/app.yml
    
You can now use confiture to update you configuration files:

    confiture your_app_name

or if you only want to update selected config files:

    confiture your_app_name apache
    confiture your_app_name god

if the config files already exist, confiture will ask you what you want to do, if you are using confiture non-interactively (via capistrano for example) you might want to specify the -f option to override files without asking:

    confiture your_app_name -f


Config File Syntax
------------------

Config files are in YAML format, and the syntax is compatible with those used by mongrel_cluster, so you can actually point your mongrel cluster at this file and run it as the configuration:

    name: tensor
    kind: rails

    cwd: /var/rails/tensor/current

    address: 127.0.0.1

    port: 8001
    servers: 3

    environment: production
    pid_file: log/mongrel.pid

    host:
      name: default
      port: 80
      domain: tensor.se
      aliases:
        - www.tensor.se

Name is a required parameter, kind is assumed to be 'rails' when not set. Multiple hosts can be specified like this:

    name: tensor
    kind: rails

    cwd: /var/rails/tensor/current

    address: 127.0.0.1

    port: 8001
    servers: 3

    environment: production
    pid_file: log/mongrel.pid

    hosts:
      -
        name: default
        port: 80
        domain: tensor.se
        aliases:
          - www.tensor.se
      -
        name: secure
        type: https
        host: 192.45.34.12
        port: 443
        domain: secure.tensor.se
        aliases:
          - blah.tensor.se
          - dorr.tensor.se
          - gurr.tensor.se
